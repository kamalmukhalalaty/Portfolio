# Projects:

## [Project 1: Salary Prediction Challenge Kaggle](https://github.com/kamalmukhalalaty/Kaggle-Salary-Predictions)

The challenge objective: tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in the given survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A ‚Äústory‚Äù could be defined any number of ways, and that‚Äôs deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. 

I decided to do both the data exploration and build a predictive model using logistic regression to predict the salaries of the survey participants.

This project involved:
- Data cleaning, wrangling and manipulation
- Imputation of missing values 
- Statistical Analysis 
- Data exploration
- Visualization
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analyisis
