# Projects:

## [Project 1: Salary Prediction Challenge Kaggle](https://github.com/kamalmukhalalaty/Kaggle-Salary-Predictions)

The challenge objective: tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in the given survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A ‚Äústory‚Äù could be defined any number of ways, and that‚Äôs deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. 

I decided to do both the data exploration and build a predictive model using logistic regression to predict the salaries of the survey participants.

This project involved:
- Data cleaning, wrangling and manipulation
- Imputation of missing values 
- Statistical Analysis 
- Data exploration
- Visualization
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analyisis

## [Project 2: Twitter tweets Sentiment Analysis on US Election Dataset]()

For this project I work with two labeled datasets. One containing generic tweets from twitter & their respective pre-labeled sentiment, another containing a filtered list of US Election relevant tweets. 

Training and validating my initial model on the generic tweets yeilded great results.

My goal was to build a sentiment prediction model based on the generic tweets and test its prediction performance on the election relevant tweets. 

preprocessed tweets using RegEx, NLTK and created both TF-IDF and Bag of Words encodings of the resulting corpus.

## [Project 3: Time-Series Forcasting of Covid-19 Data via manually tuned ARIMA]()

Performed time-series forecasting on NY State‚Äôs Covid-19 data with manually tuned ARIMA, SARIMA and SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous data) models. The SARIMAX model included hypothesis testing of the exogenous data‚Äôs correlations.

## [Project 3 A data driven approach to redisigning U of T's MEng. Analytics Emphasis]()

Web Scraped LinkedIn Data Science job descriptions pre-processed and parsed the data before running Agglomerative Clustering on the mentioned skills based on inter-job-description term frequencies and produced a dendrogram to showcase results. 

## [Project 4: Big Data Hadoop MapReduce Program via Hadoop Streaming]()

Built a Hadoop MapReduce k-means clustering program from scratch using Hadoop‚Äôs Streaming API.  Orchestrated training iterations via a Bash script to pass data between my Python written mapper and reducer via STDIN and STDOUT.

##¬†[Project 5&6: Machine Learning on Big Data via Spark, PySpark, MLlib]()
‚Ä¢	Created a big data movie recommender system using Alternating Least Square (ALS) on Databricks in PySpark leveraging MLlib.]

‚Ä¢	Created a big data raud detection system system on Databricks in PySpark leveraging MLlib.


## [Project 6: Neural Network design from the control flow graph to backpropagation to coding the algorithms from scratch for MLP, RNN, GANs and ResNet in Python using only Numpy.]
